## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Styled Components
- **AI**: Google Gemini API
- **Storage**: IndexedDB with localStorage fallback
- **Hosting**: Firebase Hosting
- **Containerization**: Docker

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Firebase project with Hosting enabled
- Google Gemini API key
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bishtranjan1/ai-chatbot.git
cd ai-chatbot
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
REACT_APP_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
```

For production, create a `.env.production` file with the same variables.

### 4. Running locally

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the development server at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

## Docker Support

The application is containerized with Docker for consistent deployment across environments.

### Running with Docker

#### Simple Script for Environment Variables

The easiest way to run the application with Docker:

```bash
# Make the script executable (first time only)
chmod +x docker-run-with-env.sh

# Run development version with API key from command line
./docker-run-with-env.sh dev --key YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY

# Run production version with API key from .env.production file
./docker-run-with-env.sh prod --env .env.production

# Run in background
./docker-run-with-env.sh prod --key YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY background
```

#### Development Mode

```bash
# Build and start the development container
docker-compose up app-dev

# Or build and run in background
docker-compose up -d app-dev
```

This starts the application with hot reloading at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

#### Production Mode

```bash
# Build and start the production container
docker-compose up app-prod

# Or build and run in background
docker-compose up -d app-prod
```

This builds the optimized production version and serves it via Nginx at [http://localhost](http://localhost).

### Building Docker Images Manually

```bash
# Build development image
docker build -t ranjan-ai-dev -f Dockerfile.dev .

# Build production image
docker build -t ranjan-ai-prod -f Dockerfile .

# Build with environment variables
docker build -t ranjan-ai-prod --build-arg REACT_APP_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key -f Dockerfile .
```

### Running Docker Containers Manually

```bash
# Run development container
docker run -p 3000:3000 -v ${PWD}:/app -v /app/node_modules --env-file .env ranjan-ai-dev

# Run production container
docker run -p 80:80 -e REACT_APP_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key ranjan-ai-prod
```

### Docker Features

The Docker setup includes:

- **Multi-stage builds** for smaller production images
- **Environment variable handling** at build and runtime
- **Healthchecks** to ensure application availability
- **Resource constraints** to limit CPU and memory usage
- **Nginx configuration** for proper SPA routing

## Deployment

The application is configured for Firebase Hosting deployment:

```bash
# Install Firebase CLI if you haven't already
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Login to Firebase
firebase login

# Initialize Firebase (first time only)
firebase init

# Deploy to Firebase Hosting
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

## Live Demo

The application is deployed at: [https://chatbotai-40d8b.web.app](https://chatbotai-40d8b.web.app)

## Key Features

### Hinglish Support

The chatbot can understand and respond in Hinglish (Hindi-English mix) when:

- User writes messages in Hinglish
- User activates the Hinglish mode using the toggle

### Offline Storage

Chat history is stored locally in your browser using:

- Primary: IndexedDB for efficient storage of larger data
- Fallback: localStorage for browsers without IndexedDB support

### Mobile-First Design

The application is designed for optimal use on mobile devices:

- Responsive layout adapts to different screen sizes
- Touch-friendly controls
- Installable as a home screen app

```
